; The address on which to accept FastCGI requests.
; Valid syntaxes are:
;   'ip.add.re.ss:port'    - to listen on a TCP socket to a specific address on a specific port;
;   '[ip:6:addr]:port'     - to listen on a TCP socket to a specific IPv6 address on a specific port;
;   'port'                 - to listen on a TCP socket to all addresses on a specific port;
;   '/path/to/unix/socket' - to listen on a unix socket.
; Default Value: any

; Set permissions for unix socket, if one is used. In Linux, read/write permissions must be set in order to allow the web server to read and write to the socket.

; Choose how the process manager will control the number of child processes.
; Possible Values:
;   static  - a fixed number (pm.max_children) of child processes;
;   dynamic - the number of child processes are set dynamically based on the following directives;
;   ondemand - no children are created at startup. Children will be forked when new requests will connect.
; Default Value: dynamic
